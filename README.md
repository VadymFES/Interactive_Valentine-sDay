# Interactive Valentine's Day Proposal
## Description
This project is a playful and interactive web application designed to offer a unique and engaging way to ask someone to be your Valentine. It utilizes React's powerful state management features to dynamically update the UI based on user interactions. The application displays a series of GIFs and messages that change as the user interacts with the "Yes" and "No" buttons, creating a fun and memorable experience.

## Features
Dynamic GIF Display: Showcases different GIFs based on the user's choices, with a special celebration GIF when the user clicks "Yes".

Engaging Button Interactions: The "No" button gradually becomes less opaque with each click, and the "Yes" button increases in scale, emphasizing the encouragement to say "Yes".

Custom Messages: Displays a series of playful and persuasive messages encouraging the user to reconsider if they initially choose "No".

Celebration Mode: When the user clicks "Yes", the app reveals a celebratory message and hides the question and buttons to highlight the celebration.

Responsive Design: Utilizes CSS modules for styling, ensuring a responsive and attractive layout across different devices.
